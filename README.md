## This repository supports the Brain Tumor Identification project by Team Thunder Pandas. The goal of the project is to develop and evaluate a YOLO-based deep learning model capable of accurately and efficiently detecting and localizing brain tumors in MRI scans. This repository is organized for reproducibility and clarity, following best practices for open data science projects. It contains all scripts, data documentation, outputs, and supporting files needed to understand, reproduce, and extend the analyses.
