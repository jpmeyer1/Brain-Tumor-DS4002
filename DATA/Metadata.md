## Data Summary
A brain tumor detection dataset consists of medical images from MRI or CT scans, containing information about brain tumor presence, location, and characteristics. This dataset is essential for training computer vision algorithms to automate brain tumor identification, aiding in early diagnosis and treatment planning in healthcare applications.

## Provenance
The Ultralytics Brain‑Tumor Dataset is a publicly documented medical-imaging dataset curated by Ultralytics. It comprises 893 labeled training images and 223 labeled test images drawn from MRI or CT brain scans, with binary class annotations for “negative” (no tumor) and “positive” (tumor present). The dataset is supplied in a standardized YOLO-formatted structure (images and corresponding annotation files) and accompanied by a YAML configuration specifying dataset paths and class names. The dataset is intended for research and development of real-time object-detection models in clinical and diagnostic contexts, such as early tumor identification and treatment-planning support.
